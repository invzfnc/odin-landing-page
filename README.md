# Odin Landing Page

This is for an [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) from The Odin Project: Foundations.

This project aims to recreate this webpage screenshot shown below using HTML and CSS:

<img src="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png" height="700" width="auto">

## Usage
Simply open the GitHub pages link, or clone this repository and open `index.html` using any browser.

It is recommended to open this site on desktop, it works fine but does not look as good and intended on mobile.


## Extras
Personal touchups/customization: 
- Hover effects on header links, buttons and info boxes
- The buttons function ;)
- Mini easter egg triggered by clicking certain element

Thoughts:
- I feel like I'm using too much flexbox and divs to align things
- I could try to refactor the code and remove redundant stuff after I figure out how

## Credits
Design by The Odin Project, built by myself.
